Introduction:
This is a basic express application which uses node https module to make requests 
to the Insurance REST API and contains custom apis that perform functions on the 
data received from the Insurance APIs. 

1- To run the server, kindly use command "npm start" or "node ./bin/www" in terminal.
2- The routing code is present in app.js, while server configuration can be viewed 
   in ./bin/www file. 
3- To test the server apis, simply send requests using any standard api client 
   e.g Postman on "localhost:3000/$apipath".
